# 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
## Easy

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
```javascript
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its bottom-up level order traversal as:
```javascript
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```
